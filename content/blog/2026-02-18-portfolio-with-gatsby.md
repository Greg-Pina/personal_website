Gatsby is a solid first React framework because it is static-first, easy to host, and still gives you the component model you will use everywhere else.

My focus for this build was:

- A clean content structure with Markdown for posts.
- A working RSS feed.
- Lightweight data files for projects and videos.

Once content is stable, the same structure can move to Next.js later with minimal disruption.
