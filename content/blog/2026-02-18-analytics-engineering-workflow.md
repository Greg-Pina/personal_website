A dependable analytics workflow is built on three loops:

- **Instrument**: agree on event names, ownership, and validation.
- **Model**: create a canonical dataset that business users trust.
- **Decide**: make outcomes visible with a short summary and next step.

If you keep the loop tight, stakeholders stay aligned and the data keeps its value.
