When a dashboard is busy but decisions are still slow, the missing piece is often a clear decision loop. A useful structure is:

1. **Signal**: define the metric that tells you something changed.
2. **Diagnosis**: identify what likely caused the change.
3. **Action**: list the choices that are now on the table.
4. **Cost**: what does it cost to be wrong?
5. **Decision**: what will you do, and when?

This keeps analysis focused on action and prevents endless metric churn.
